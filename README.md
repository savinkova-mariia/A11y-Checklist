# Exhibitions for All

The goal of the project 
is to create an interactive accessibility guide 
for museums and cultural institutions. Most of 
the well-known guidelines are made in the form 
of PDF files. In the digital world, this format 
is no longer convenient.

## Features

- Anchor Links: the user can easily navigate a long one-pager via menu and anchor links
- Checklist: the user can mark the item taken into account immediately on the page.
- Expandable Guide Items: each item contains brief information, but it can be expanded

Each item contains an example of a good 
and bad implementation of the guideline item. 
The user can follow the link and read more about 
the museum museum
